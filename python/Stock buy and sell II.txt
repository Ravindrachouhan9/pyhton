The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[] of size n. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day, Find the maximum profit which you can get.

Note: You can only hold one stock at a time.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
a = {3, 4, 1, 5}
Output:
5
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 3) and sell it on 
day 2 (at price 4) profit will be 4-3=1, 
We can buy another stock on day 3 (at price 1) and sell 
it on day 4 (at price 5) profit will be 5-1=4, 
which will give us maximum profit of 5.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
a = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Output:
8
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 1) and sell it on 
day 5 (at price 9), 
which will give us maximum profit of 8.
Your Task:
Complete stockBuyAndSell() function which takes an array of Prices as input and returns the maximum profit achieved as described in the problem statement.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= price[i] <= 104

    def stockBuyAndSell(self, n : int, prices : List[int]) -> int:
        # code here

        max_profit = 0
        curr_bprice = 0
        for i in range(n-1):
            if curr == "s":
                if prices[i+1] >= prices[i]:
                    curr = "b"
                    curr_bprice = prices[i]
            if curr == "b":
                if prices[i+1] <= prices[i]:
                    curr = "s"
                    max_profit += prices[i] - curr_bprice
        if curr == "b":
            max_profit += prices[n-1] - curr_bprice
        return max_profit
